# Relationship-Map
This program uses data structures in order to map (graphs) to display rellationships between various things. In this case, the program uses "friends" via name and university affiliation. It has numerous methods that can tell you, for example, the shortest relationship chain from Person A to Person B.

I wrote this program as an assigment for my DS class at my University.

I hope you like it.
